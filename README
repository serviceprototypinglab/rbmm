Proof-of-concept implementation of a rule-based matchmaker.

The matchmaking library (matchmaker.py) implements both iterative
combinatorial matchmaking and recursive matchmaking between a set of
application parts (e.g. components, microservices) to be deployed to a
set of resources. The matchmaking adheres to propagation, deployment,
accumulation and skipping rules.

The synthetic generator (generator.py) generates sets of application
parts, resources and rules and can be used to benchmark the matchmaking
performance.
